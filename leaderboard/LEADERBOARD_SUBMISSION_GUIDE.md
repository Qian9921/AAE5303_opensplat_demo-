# AAE5303 Assignment 2 - Leaderboard Submission Guide

## 📋 Overview

This guide explains how to submit your 3D Gaussian Splatting results for leaderboard evaluation. The leaderboard ranks submissions based on three rendering quality metrics: **PSNR**, **SSIM**, and **LPIPS**.

---

## 🎯 Evaluation Metrics

Your submission will be evaluated on **held-out test views** using the following metrics:

| Metric | Direction | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **PSNR** | ↑ Higher is better | Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (dB) |
| **SSIM** | ↑ Higher is better | Structural Similarity Index (0-1) |
| **LPIPS** | ↓ Lower is better | Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (0-1) |

All three metrics are reported independently. There is no combined/weighted score.

## 📁 Submission Requirements

### Required Files

```
{StudentID}_submission/
├── model/
│   └── {StudentID}_hkisland.ply      # Required: Your trained model
├── rendered/                          # Required: Rendered test views
│   ├── test_view_001.png
│   ├── test_view_002.png
│   └── ... 
└── metadata.json                      # Required: Submission metadata
```

### 1. Model File (`.ply`)

- **Format**: PLY (binary little endian)
- **Generated by**: OpenSplat
- **Naming**: `{StudentID}_hkisland.ply`
- **Content**: Trained 3D Gaussian model

### 2. Rendered Images

- **Format**: PNG
- **Resolution**: Same as test view ground truth
- **Content**: Your model rendered from the test viewpoints
- **Naming**: Must match the test view filenames exactly

### 3. Metadata File (`metadata.json`)

```json
{
    "student_id": "YOUR_STUDENT_ID",
    "student_name": "Your Name",
    "submission_date": "2024-12-17",
    "training_config": {
        "num_iterations": 30000,
        "sh_degree": 3,
        "device": "cuda"
    },
    "self_reported_metrics": {
        "psnr": 25.5,
        "ssim": 0.87,
        "lpips": 0.12
    },
    "notes": "Optional notes about your submission"
}
```

## 🖼️ Test View Rendering

### Step 1: Obtain Test View Information

Test view camera poses will be provided in a separate file:
- **File**: `test_cameras.json` *(to be released)*
- **Content**: Camera intrinsics and extrinsics for test views

### Step 2: Render Test Views

Use your trained model to render images from the test viewpoints.

**Using OpenSplat** (if supported):
```bash
./opensplat /path/to/data --resume your_model.ply --render-only --cameras test_cameras.json
```

**Using External Viewer**:
- Load your `.ply` file in a Gaussian Splatting viewer
- Set camera to test view poses
- Export rendered images

### Step 3: Image Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| Format | PNG |
| Resolution | Same as ground truth |
| Color Space | sRGB |
| Background | White (RGB: 255, 255, 255) |
| Naming | Match test view filenames exactly |

---

## 📤 Submission Process

### Step 1: Prepare Files

1. Create submission folder: `{StudentID}_submission/`
2. Add your PLY model to `model/`
3. Add rendered test views to `rendered/`
4. Create and fill `metadata.json`

### Step 2: Verify Submission

Before submitting, verify:
- [ ] PLY file loads correctly
- [ ] All test views are rendered
- [ ] Image filenames match exactly
- [ ] Metadata JSON is valid
- [ ] File sizes are reasonable

### Step 3: Submit

**Submission Portal**: *To be announced*

The submission website link and deadline will be provided separately.

## 📊 Leaderboard Display

Your results will appear on the leaderboard as:

| Rank | Student ID | PSNR ↑ | SSIM ↑ | LPIPS ↓ | Submission Date |
|:----:|:----------:|:------:|:------:|:-------:|:---------------:|
| 1 | 12345678 | 28.45 | 0.912 | 0.078 | 2024-12-17 |
| 2 | 23456789 | 27.82 | 0.905 | 0.085 | 2024-12-17 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

- Default sorting: by PSNR (descending)
- Website will allow sorting by any metric

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### File Size Limits
- PLY model: < 500 MB
- Total submission: < 600 MB

### Submission Rules
- Maximum **3 submissions** per student
- Only the **best result** will be shown on the leaderboard
- Late submissions may not be evaluated

### Academic Integrity
- Submit only your own work
- Do not share model files with other students
- Plagiarism will result in disqualification

## 🔗 Resources

| Resource | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Test View Camera Poses | 🔜 To be released |
| Leaderboard Website | 🔜 To be announced |
| Baseline Results | 🔜 To be released |
| Ground Truth Test Images | 🔜 For evaluation only (not provided) |

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I submit multiple times?**

A: Yes, up to 3 submissions. Only your best result will be displayed.

**Q: Do I need to submit rendered images or will they be generated?**

A: You must submit rendered images. The evaluation server compares your rendered images against ground truth.

**Q: What if my rendering software produces different results?**

A: Ensure you use the exact camera poses provided. Small differences in rendering pipelines are acceptable.

**Q: When will the test views be released?**

A: Test view information will be announced separately before the submission deadline.

**Q: Is there a baseline to compare against?**

A: Baseline results will be published on the leaderboard website.
